Ticket confirmation: Once the transaction is completed, the system provides users with a confirmation of their booking, including the details of the journey, the seat numbers, and the total cost.

The application can be developed using Python programming language, which provides many libraries and modules for building GUI applications, such as Tkinter. The system can also integrate with online payment gateways to provide secure and efficient payment processing.

Overall, a bus ticket booking system using Python and Tkinter can offer a convenient and user-friendly way for customers to book bus tickets and can be a valuable tool for bus companies to manage their operations and increase efficiency
